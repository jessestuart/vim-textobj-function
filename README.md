# vim-textobj-function

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jessestuart/vim-textobj-function.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jessestuart/vim-textobj-function)

vim-textobj-function is a Vim plugin to **text objects for functions**. You can
directly target a function (`af`) or the code inside a function (`if`).
For example,

- `daf` to <strong>D</strong>elete <strong>A</strong> <strong>F</strong>unction, and
- `vif` to <strong>V</strong>isually select the code <strong>I</strong>nside a <strong>F</strong>unction.

You can also use `aF` to target a function with leading or trailing blank
lines like `ap`, or use `iF` to target just a function like `ip`.
For example,

- `yaF` to <strong>Y</strong>ank <strong>A</strong> <strong>F</strong>unction with leading or trailing blank lines, and
- `viF` to visually select a function without leading or trailing blank lines.

The syntax of a "function" is varied for each language. So that you have to
tell the syntax of a function to vim-textobj-function before editing.
The following languages are currently supported:

- C language
- C#
- Java
- JavaScript
- Julia
- Perl
- PHP
- Python
- Ruby
- Vim script
  (including [vim-vspec](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec)-specific syntax)

To support new languages, see:
